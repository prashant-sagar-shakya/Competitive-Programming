# Prashant's Competitive Programming Odyssey üöÄüß†üíª

**Welcome to my CP journey where logic meets code.**  
This repository documents my deep dive into the world of Competitive Programming (CP), showcasing organized problem-solving across renowned platforms. Each folder represents a curated track or method to sharpen and test my skills.

## üìÅ Folder Structure Overview

- **A2OJ Codeforces Ally**  
  Contains solutions from A2OJ ladders tailored for Codeforces. This structured ladder system helped me incrementally improve my skill level by tackling increasingly complex problems.

- **By-CF-Handles**  
  A unique collection of solutions categorized based on Codeforces user handles. This might include problems solved during group upsolving, practice with friends, or community challenges.

- **CSES**  
  A foundational set focused on algorithmic strength and fundamental problem-solving. Excellent for building and testing core concepts across a wide range of topics.

- **TLE 31**  
  Contains solutions to the **TLE 31 problem sheet** curated by **TLE Eliminators (Priyansh Agarwal)**. This sheet consists of **31 handpicked Codeforces problems**, one from each difficulty level, to comprehensively cover a broad range of concepts and challenges.

## üåü Philosophy & Approach

My approach to CP is rooted in:

1. **Fundamental Understanding:** Prioritizing solid grasp over brute-force attempts. CSES plays a key role in building this base.
2. **Consistent Practice:** Leveraging ladders (A2OJ), peer-based learning (By-CF-Handles), and curated challenges like TLE 31.
3. **Progressive Challenge:** Moving from basic to advanced difficulty across problem sets.
4. **Code Quality:** Focusing on clarity, optimality, and maintainability. Solutions are in ***C++*** with thoughtful structuring.
